# YaoML
Quantum machine learning in Julia using Yao.jl

This package aims to implement popular QML algorithms such as QSVMs ("Quantum Support Vector Machines") and VQCs ("Variational Quantum Circuit", also known as "Quantum Neural Network"). This package is still in it's early stages and likely to change.
